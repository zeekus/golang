Q: what are different types of loops in the go language ? 

A: In Go, there are two types of loops: for loops and for-range loops.

The for loop is the most basic looping construct in Go and has the following syntax:


```
for initializer; condition; post {
    // loop body
}
```

Here, the initializer is a statement that is executed before the loop starts. It is often used to initialize a loop counter. The condition is a boolean expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. If the condition is false, the loop terminates. The post statement is executed after the loop body on each iteration.

Here is an example of a for loop that counts from 1 to 10:

```
for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

The for-range loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array, slice, string, map, or channel. It has the following syntax:

```
for key, value := range collection {
    // loop body
}
```

Here, key is the index of the current element and value is the element itself. If you don't need the index, you can use the blank identifier _ to ignore it.

Here is an example of a for-range loop that iterates over the elements of a slice:

```
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
for _, num := range numbers {
    fmt.Println(num)
}
```

This will print the numbers 1 through 5 on separate lines.
