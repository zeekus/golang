
Q: if x is an integer of 10, how would I print this as a string in go ? 

A: To print the value of an integer as a string in Go, you can use the fmt package's Sprintf function. This function allows you to create a string by formatting a value using a format string.

Here is an example of how you can use Sprintf to convert an integer to a string:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 10
	str := fmt.Sprintf("%d", x)
	fmt.Println(str)
}
```

This program will print "10" to the console.

The %d format specifier in the format string tells Sprintf to treat the value as an integer and format it as a decimal number. You can use other format specifiers to format the value in different ways. For example, you can use %b to format the value as a binary number, or %x to format it as a hexadecimal number.

You can also use the strconv package's Itoa function to convert an integer to a string. This function takes an integer and returns its string representation as a string type. Here is an example of how you can use Itoa to convert an integer to a string:

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "strconv"

func main() {
	x := 10
	str := strconv.Itoa(x)
	fmt.Println(str)
}
```

This program will also print "10" to the console.
