Q: how would I write a go program to find an image of a camel on the screen if I have a picture called camel.jpg that approximates a camel on the screen with only 70% certainty ?

A: To write a Go program that finds an image of a camel on the screen, you can use a computer vision library like OpenCV or GoCV. These libraries provide a variety of image processing and machine learning functions that can be used to detect and recognize objects in images and video.

Here is an example of how you might use the GoCV library to find an image of a camel on the screen:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"image"
	"os"

	"gocv.io/x/gocv"
)

func main() {
	// Load the image of the camel
	img := gocv.IMRead("camel.jpg", gocv.IMReadColor)
	if img.Empty() {
		fmt.Println("Error: Could not load image")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Load the classifier for detecting camels
	classifier := gocv.NewCascadeClassifier()
	defer classifier.Close()

	if !classifier.Load("camel_classifier.xml") {
		fmt.Println("Error: Could not load classifier")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Detect camels in the image
	rects := classifier.DetectMultiScale(img)

	// Check if a camel was detected with at least 70% certainty
	if len(rects) > 0 && rects[0].Confidence > 0.7 {
		fmt.Println("Camel detected")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Camel not detected")
	}
}
```

This program loads an image of a camel from a file called camel.jpg and uses a classifier to detect camels in the image. The classifier is a machine learning model that has been trained to recognize camels based on features in the image. In this example, the classifier is loaded from a file called camel_classifier.xml.

The DetectMultiScale function uses the classifier to search the image for camels and returns a slice of rectangles that enclose the detected camels. The program checks if at least one camel was detected and if the confidence level is greater than 70%. If these conditions are met, the program prints "Camel detected". Otherwise, it prints "Camel not detected".

Note that this example is just one way of implementing object detection in Go using a computer vision library. There are many other options and techniques that you can use depending on your specific requirements.
