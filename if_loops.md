Q: are there if then else statements in the Go language ? If there are can you give me an example ? 

A: Yes, Go has an if-else statement that allows you to execute different code blocks depending on whether a boolean expression evaluates to true or false.

The syntax for an if-else statement in Go is:

```
if condition {
    // code block to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if condition is false
}
```

Here is an example of an if-else statement in Go:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 10

	if x > 0 {
		fmt.Println("x is positive")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("x is not positive")
	}
}

```

This program will print "x is positive" because the value of x (10) is greater than 0.

You can also use an if statement without an else block if you only want to execute a code block if the condition is true. For example:

```
if x%2 == 0 {
	fmt.Println("x is even")
}
```

In this case, the code block will only be executed if x is even.

It's worth noting that Go also has a switch statement, which is another way of expressing conditional logic in your code. The switch statement allows you to test a single value against multiple possible values and execute different code blocks for each match. The if-else statement is generally more flexible and can be used to test more complex conditions, but the switch statement may be easier to read and write in certain cases.
